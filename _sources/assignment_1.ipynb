Repeat the benchmarking from the first part and compare the Numba compiled function against the pure Python version. What speed-up do you achieve with Numba? Once you have done this parallelise the function using `numba.prange`. Explain your parallelisation strategy and benchmark the resulting function. The function should parallelise almost perfectly. The optimal speed-up is roughly given by the number of physical CPU cores that you have. What is the actual speed-up that you measure compared to the theoretical speed-up?"

Implement a parallel Numba accelerated diffusion step that implements this additional condition and again create a nice visualisation. You need to change the interface of your `diffusion_interface` function to take an additional parameter `constant_indices` where you can pass the information about which indices should be kept constant. Explain the data structure you choose for this condition and how you implement it."

    "* Up to 80% of the coursework can be achieved by a perfect solution for Parts 1 to 3. The Advanced Problem is worth an additional 20%.\n",
    "* The assignment does not require much code writing. But a strong emphasis is put on good explanations. Putting a few comment lines in your code is not sufficient as explanation. Use the Jupyter notebook capabilities and write good explanations about what you are doing and why you are doing it as markdown cells.\n",
    "* Your code must be executable without any errors from scratch in Jupyter by choosing \"Restart kernel and run all cells.\" If this produces any errors, any code and explanations after the error occurs will be ignored for the marking. It is not the task of the markers to debug your code.\n",
    "* The code should not run for much longer than 2 minutes on a typical laptop/desktop. This is a soft limit. If your notebook runs too long we reserve the right to reject it.\n",
    "* In addition to core Python packages you are allowed to use Numpy, Numba, and matplotlib. No other packages are allowed and any such request will be rejected.\n",
    "* Any matplotlib output must appear inside your notebook. For more information on how to do this see here: https://medium.com/@1522933668924/using-matplotlib-in-jupyter-notebooks-comparing-methods-and-some-tips-python-c38e85b40ba1. A tutorial on embedding animations is shown here:\n",
